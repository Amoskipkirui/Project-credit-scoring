### Customer Credit Scoring Project

This repository contains the documentation and code for the Customer Credit Scoring project at XYZ Credit. The project's objective is to develop an automated credit scoring model using data-driven methodologies to provide objective measures of credit risk. The model aims to enhance the accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of evaluating loan applicants' creditworthiness.

### Project Overview

XYZ Credit is a prominent financial institution that recognizes the importance of improving their credit risk assessment process. The current manual review and subjective judgment process lead to inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and increased human error. To address these challenges, the company is undertaking a data-driven approach to credit scoring.

The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection and Understanding: We sourced historical loan applicant data from Kaggle. The dataset contains various attributes related to applicants' demographics, financial history, and credit behavior.

2. Data Preprocessing and Exploration: In this phase, we cleaned and prepared the data for analysis. We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and handle missing or outlier data.

3. Feature Engineering: We engineered relevant features from the raw data to provide the model with essential information for credit risk assessment.

4. Model Building: Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, were applied to build predictive credit scoring models. The models were trained on a labeled dataset, where each applicant is labeled as either a good or bad credit risk based on historical outcomes.

5. Model Evaluation: The performance of each model was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluation helped identify the best-performing model for deployment.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning: We fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the selected model to improve its predictive accuracy and generalizability.

7. Model Deployment: The final model was deployed into XYZ Credit's credit risk assessment system, automating the scoring process for new loan applicants.--------In process

### Conclusion and Next Steps

The automated credit scoring model developed in this project significantly improves the credit risk assessment process at XYZ Credit. It provides objective and data-driven measures of creditworthiness, reducing the potential for human bias and errors in decision-making.

As next steps, XYZ Credit can consider the following:

1. Monitor and Fine-tune the Model: Regularly monitor the model's performance and retrain it with updated data to maintain its accuracy and relevance.

2. Interpretability: Enhance the model's interpretability to ensure transparency and regulatory compliance.

3. Expand Data Sources: Explore additional data sources to further improve the model's accuracy and predictive power.

4. Continuous Improvement: Continuously seek feedback from credit analysts and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement and optimize the credit scoring process further.
